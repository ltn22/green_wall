Terminologies

Sensor   - To measure humidity
Actuator  - Water Pump
Wall  - Green wall 


Requirements for Communication between PyCOM and Web Server (COAP API)

To store the humidity data collected using sensors and store it in MongoDB using COAP  api on Web Server - use of CBOR for data transmission.
Utilisation of SCHC for header compression 
To make this code extensible so that in future we can also store the measurements for temperature and pressure.
Send data from actuator to COAP api on web server - how much time it watered the wall, when was the last time it watered the wall
Store the data from actuator in the MongoDB database.
Based on the logic in the web server API, send the actuator the parameters to water the wall.

Requirements for Communication between end-user and web server (REST API)

Fetch the current state of the wall, in terms of level of humidity
Fetch the data of history of the process of watering the wall - the frequency, time, duration etc. (only far last n hours/days)
Fetch the humidity levels of a particular area of the wall (a particular sensor) for a particular period of time.
